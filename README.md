<p align="center">I am a skilled full-stack developer with extensive experience in web development, utilizing technologies like Node.js, HTML5, CSS,  MongoDB, JavaScript, React, etc. I have actively contributed to noteworthy open source initiatives like Script Winter of Code and DevScript Winter of Code. Previously, I held a role as a frontend web developer at Agriyoda Innovations, a startup focused on delivering cutting-edge solutions for the agriculture sector and I have worked as a full-stack developer for Meau.in where I have contributed to developing the core of a linktree app . Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in computer science at Pace University, where I am dedicated to advancing my proficiency in web and software development. My passion lies in crafting intuitive and scalable web applications that address real-world challenges and elevate user experiences. I am committed to continuous learning, always eager to explore new technologies and frameworks, and thrive on collaborating with fellow developers and stakeholders. I am now seeking opportunities to apply my expertise in full-stack development to impactful and stimulating projects</p>
